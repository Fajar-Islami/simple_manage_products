# Why clean architecture is good for your application ? if yes, please explain

Clean architecture provides a clear separation of concerns, making the application easy to test, maintain, and adaptable to changes. It also allows us to be independent of any framework.

By following clean architecture principles, the application becomes more testable, as the business logic is isolated from external dependencies such as the database, file system, network, etc. This separation makes it easier to write unit tests, integration tests, and automated tests.

Moreover, changes made to one layer will not affect other layers. This is due to the clear separation of concerns and reduced coupling between different layers. This separation makes it easier to add new features, change the technology stack, or scale the application without affecting the existing code. Overall, clean architecture provides a solid foundation for building robust, maintainable, and scalable software applications.

# How to scale up your application and when it needs to be
To increase application scalability, we can consider the following strategies:

1. Breaking down the application into separate services (microservices): by separating the application's functions into separate services, we can scale each service independently, allowing for more optimal resource utilization and improved application performance.

2. Using a load balancer: load balancers distribute workload evenly across available servers, enabling horizontal scaling by adding more servers as needed.
